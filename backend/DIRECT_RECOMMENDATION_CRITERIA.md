## 🚨 Safety & Quality Controls

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Randomly call recommended workers to verify responsiveness
   - Check if they're still active and available

2. **Customer Feedback Loop**
   - After recommendation, track if customer hired the worker
   - Collect feedback on recommendation quality
   - Lower scores for workers with poor follow-through

3. **Automatic Disqualification**
   - Expired subscription = instant removal from recommendations
   - Customer complaints > 2 = review/suspension
   - Unresponsive (no reply in 48hrs) = temporary suspension

## 💡 My Opinion/Recommendation

**This system is solid because:**

1. **It's fair**: Workers who invest more (time, money, guarantor) get more leads
2. **It's safe**: Multiple verification layers (ID, guarantor, subscription)
3. **It's profitable**: ₦1,000 per recommendation adds up quickly
4. **It's scalable**: Automated scoring means no manual work once built

**Start simple** (Phase 1), then enhance based on real customer feedback. The guarantor badge is your secret weapon - it's the strongest trust signal and creates serious accountability.

**One addition I'd suggest**: Offer a "satisfaction guarantee" - if customer isn't happy with all 3 recommendations, they get their ₦1,000 back. This makes customers confident to try it, and motivates you to maintain high quality.
